# Python Data Science Foundations

Python enables scalable data analysis through DataFrames and vectorized operations.

Key concepts:
- DataFrame as the core abstraction
- Column-oriented thinking
- Vectorized transformations
- Minimal, purposeful visualizations

These skills directly apply to security datasets like CICIDS.
