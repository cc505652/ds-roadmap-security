# Data Science Lifecycle Applied to Cybersecurity

## Problem Definition
In cybersecurity, the problem is often detecting abnormal or malicious behavior
from large volumes of noisy system and network data.

## Data Collection
Sources include:
- Network traffic (flows, packets)
- System and application logs
- Endpoint telemetry

## Data Cleaning Challenges
- Missing or inconsistent fields
- Extremely imbalanced data
- High noise-to-signal ratio

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps understand:
- Normal vs abnormal traffic patterns
- Distribution of attacks
- Feature relevance

## Modeling (When Needed)
Machine learning is useful for:
- Anomaly detection
- Classification of attack types

However, not all security problems require ML.

## Interpretation & Decision Making
Results must:
- Be explainable
- Minimize false positives
- Support SOC analysts in decision making

## Key Insight
In cybersecurity, understanding data and context matters more than complex models.
