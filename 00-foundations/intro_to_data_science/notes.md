# Introduction to Data Science

## What is Data Science
Data Science is the practice of extracting insights from data using statistics,
programming, and domain knowledge. The goal is not models, but decisions.

## Related Fields
- Data Analytics: analyzes past data
- Data Science: analytics + prediction
- Machine Learning: algorithmic learning from data
- Artificial Intelligence: systems that mimic intelligence

## Data Science Lifecycle
1. Problem definition
2. Data collection
3. Data cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Modeling (if needed)
6. Interpretation and communication

## Types of Data
- Structured
- Semi-structured
- Unstructured

Most cybersecurity data is semi-structured.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Visualization libraries
- SQL

## Data Science in Cybersecurity
Applications include:
- Log analysis
- Network traffic analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Threat intelligence

## Key Insight
Understanding data and context matters more than complex algorithms.
