# Data Analytics Essentials – Projects & Data Gathering

## What is a Data Analytics Project
A data analytics project aims to answer a specific question using data.
The focus is on insight and decision-making, not tools.

## Project Lifecycle
1. Define the problem
2. Identify required data
3. Collect data
4. Clean and prepare data
5. Analyze using statistics
6. Communicate insights

## Common Failure Points
- Poor problem definition
- Low-quality or biased data
- Overreliance on tools
- Ignoring data limitations

## Data Gathering
Data can come from:
- Databases
- Files (CSV, Excel)
- Logs
- APIs
- Sensors

Cybersecurity data is often log-based and semi-structured.

## Data Quality Dimensions
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Consistency
- Timeliness
- Relevance

## Key Insight
Asking the right questions about data is more important than using advanced tools.
