# Exploratory Data Analysis for Network Intrusion Detection

This project analyzes the CICIDS 2017 dataset from a security analyst’s perspective.

## Objective
To understand network traffic behavior and attack distributions before applying
any cleaning, modeling, or detection logic.

## Phase 1 Scope
- Dataset understanding
- Class distribution analysis
- Feature categorization
- Initial statistical framing

This project treats CICIDS as a SOC dataset, not a machine learning benchmark.
